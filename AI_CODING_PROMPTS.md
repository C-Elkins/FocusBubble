Requirements:
- Persist across browser restarts
- Survives service worker sleep/wake
- Accurate to the second (no drift)
- Uses chrome.alarms API (not setInterval)
- Syncs state to storage every 10 seconds

Timer State:
{
  isRunning: boolean,
  timeRemaining: number, // seconds
  duration: number, // total duration
  startTime: number | null, // timestamp
  pausedAt: number | null,
  sessionId: string,
  distractionCount: number
}

Functions:
- startTimer(duration)
- pauseTimer()
- resumeTimer()
- resetTimer()
- getTimeRemaining() // calculates from startTime
- handleTimerComplete()

Alarm Handling:
- Create alarm when timer starts
- Clear alarm on pause
- Recreate alarm on resume
- Fire completion notification when alarm triggers

Edge Cases:
- Browser closed mid-session
- Service worker terminated mid-session
- Clock changed (time zone, daylight saving)
- Multiple tabs trying to control timer
- Rapid start/stop clicks

Include comprehensive error handling and state recovery logic.
```

### Prompt 8.2: Message Passing System

```
Design a message passing system between service worker, popup, and content scripts:

Message Types:
1. Commands (popup/content ‚Üí background):
   - START_TIMER { duration }
   - PAUSE_TIMER
   - RESUME_TIMER
   - RESET_TIMER
   - GET_STATE
   - RECORD_DISTRACTION

2. Responses (background ‚Üí popup/content):
   - TIMER_STATE_UPDATE { state }
   - SESSION_COMPLETE { session }
   - ERROR { message }

3. Broadcasts (background ‚Üí all):
   - STATE_SYNC { state } (every 10s)

Implementation:
- Use chrome.runtime.sendMessage for one-off
- Use chrome.runtime.onMessage for listening
- Port connections for long-lived channels (if needed)
- Type-safe message handlers (TypeScript)
- Request/response pattern with promises

Helpers:
- sendCommand(command, data) ‚Üí Promise<response>
- onCommand(command, handler)
- broadcastState(state)
- withRetry(messageFn, maxRetries = 3)

Error Handling:
- Timeout if no response in 5 seconds

2. Session history (last 90 days)
3. User settings (preferences)
4. AI insights cache
5. Distraction log
6. Streak data
7. Statistics aggregates

Storage Strategy:
- chrome.storage.local for large data (unlimited)
- chrome.storage.sync for settings (syncs across devices, 100KB limit)
- IndexedDB for heavy data (session details, 50MB+)
- In-memory cache for frequently accessed data

Data Structure:
{
  // chrome.storage.sync (syncs across devices)
  settings: {
    defaultDuration: 25,
    tone: 'motivational',
    apiKey: 'encrypted',
    theme: 'light'
  },

  // chrome.storage.local
  currentSession: { /* timer state */ },
  sessions: [ /* last 1000 sessions */ ],
  insights: [ /* cached insights */ ],
  distractions: [ /* last 500 distractions */ ]
}

Functions:
- saveState(key, value)
- loadState(key)
- clearOldData(daysToKeep = 90)
- migrate(fromVersion, toVersion)
- backup() ‚Üí JSON string
- restore(jsonString)

Optimization:
- Debounce writes (don't save on every change)
- Batch multiple writes
- Compress large objects
- Limit array sizes (keep last N items)

Migration:
- Version tracking
- Schema migration on version bump
- Backward compatibility

Include quota management to stay under limits.
```

  timeElapsed: number, // actual time focused
  distractionCount: number,
  distractions: [
    {
      timestamp: Date,
      type: 'tab_switch' | 'window_blur' | 'manual_pause',
      duration: number // how long distracted
    }
  ],
  completed: boolean,
  abandoned: boolean,
  tags: string[], // ['work', 'coding']
  notes: string,
  taskName: string,
  mood: 'focused' | 'distracted' | 'stressed' | null
}

Aggregate Stats:
{
  totalTime: number,
  totalSessions: number,
  completedSessions: number,
  averageDuration: number,
  totalDistractions: number,
  streak: number,
  bestStreak: number,
  lastSessionDate: Date,
  byDay: {
    [date: string]: {
      time: number,
      sessions: number,
      distractions: number
    }
  },
  byHour: {
    [hour: number]: {
      sessions: number,
      avgDuration: number
    }
  }
}

Storage Keys:
- 'sessions' ‚Üí Session[]
- 'stats' ‚Üí AggregateStats
- 'currentSession' ‚Üí Session
- 'settings' ‚Üí UserSettings

Include:
- TypeScript interfaces
- Zod schemas for validation
- Migration functions for schema changes
- Indexing strategy for fast queries
```

### Prompt 9.2: Efficient Data Queries

```
Implement efficient query functions for session data:

Queries Needed:
1. Get sessions for date range
2. Get sessions by tag
3. Get top N longest sessions
4. Get sessions with fewest distractions
5. Calculate stats for time period (day/week/month)
6. Find focus patterns (best time of day)
7. Track streak (consecutive days)

Implementation:
- Use in-memory indexing for fast lookups
- Precompute aggregates to avoid recalculating
- Lazy load old sessions (only when needed)
- Cache query results with invalidation

Example Functions:
```javascript
async function getSessionsByDateRange(startDate, endDate) { }
async function calculateWeeklyStats(weekStart) { }
async function findBestFocusTime() { }
async function getCurrentStreak() { }
async function getSessionsByTag(tag) { }
```

Optimization:
- Binary search for date ranges
- Hash maps for tag lookups
- Incremental aggregate updates
- Background computation for heavy queries

Include benchmarks showing query performance (<50ms for most operations).
```

### Prompt 9.3: Data Cleanup & Maintenance

```
Create automated data cleanup and maintenance system:

Tasks:
1. Delete sessions older than 90 days (configurable)
2. Remove duplicate sessions
3. Compress session details (remove verbose fields)
4. Recalculate aggregate stats if corrupted
5. Validate data integrity
6. Optimize storage usage

Scheduled Jobs:
- Daily: cleanup old data
- Weekly: validate integrity
- Monthly: compress old sessions

Cleanup Logic:
```javascript
async function cleanupOldSessions(daysToKeep = 90) {
  // Keep recent sessions in full detail
  // Compress old sessions (remove distractions array, keep summary)
  // Delete very old sessions (>1 year)
}

async function validateDataIntegrity() {
  // Check for corrupted sessions
  // Verify stats match session data
  // Fix any inconsistencies
}

async function optimizeStorage() {
  // Remove redundant data
  // Compress JSON
  // Report storage usage
}
```

Settings:
- User configurable retention period
- Option to export before cleanup
- Manual cleanup trigger
- Show storage usage in settings

Background execution using chrome.alarms (run at 3 AM daily).
```

## ‚ö° Optimization & Performance

### Prompt 14.1: Performance Optimization

```
Optimize FocusBubble extension for performance:

Areas to Optimize:

1. Service Worker
   - Minimize wake-ups (batch operations)
   - Use alarms instead of setInterval
   - Lazy load modules
   - Optimize message passing (debounce state updates)
   - Profile memory usage (avoid leaks)

2. Popup UI
   - Code splitting (load dashboard on demand)
   - Lazy load charts (Recharts is heavy)
   - Virtualize long lists (session history)
   - Optimize re-renders (React.memo, useMemo)
   - Image optimization (compress icons, use SVG)

3. Content Script
   - Inject only when needed
   - Minimize DOM manipulation
   - Use CSS transforms (not top/left)
   - Debounce drag events
   - Remove event listeners on cleanup

4. Storage
   - Compress session data (JSON.stringify is verbose)
   - Batch writes (don't save on every tick)
   - Use IndexedDB for large data (>5MB)
   - Implement LRU cache for frequent reads

5. Network
   - Cache AI insights (same input = same output)
   - Retry failed requests with exponential backoff
   - Cancel in-flight requests on unmount
   - Use request deduplication

Techniques:
- Bundle splitting
- Tree shaking
- Minification
- Compression
- Lazy loading
- Memoization
- Debouncing
- Throttling

Metrics to Track:
- Service worker memory usage (<10 MB)
- Popup load time (<500ms)
- Storage operations (<50ms)
- Message latency (<10ms)
- Content script injection time (<100ms)

Provide before/after performance benchmarks.
```

### Prompt 14.2: Bundle Size Optimization

```
Reduce extension bundle size:

Current Size (estimate):
- Popup bundle: ~500 KB
- Content script: ~150 KB
- Service worker: ~50 KB
- Total: ~700 KB

Target Size:
- Popup: <300 KB
- Content: <80 KB
- Service worker: <30 KB
- Total: <410 KB

Strategies:

1. Dependencies
   - Replace Recharts with lighter alternative (Chart.js?)
   - Use Preact instead of React (3KB vs 40KB)
   - Replace Framer Motion with CSS animations
   - Remove unused lodash functions (use native)
   - Tree-shake Tailwind (purge unused classes)

2. Code Splitting
   - Separate dashboard into lazy-loaded chunk
   - Load AI module only when needed
   - Async import heavy dependencies

3. Compression
   - Enable gzip in build
   - Use brotli for static assets
   - Minify JSON data

4. Assets
   - Use SVG instead of PNG (where possible)
   - Compress images with imagemin
   - Inline small icons (<2KB) as data URIs
   - Use icon font instead of individual SVGs

5. Build Config
```javascript
// webpack.config.js
optimization: {
  minimize: true,
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all',
    maxSize: 200000
  },
  usedExports: true // tree shaking
}
```

6. Analyze Bundle
   - Use webpack-bundle-analyzer
   - Identify large dependencies
   - Find duplicate code

Report:
- Bundle size before/after
- Load time improvement
- List removed dependencies
- Alternative lighter libraries

Provide complete webpack config.
```

### Prompt 14.3: Memory Management

```
Implement robust memory management to prevent leaks:

Common Leak Sources:
1. Event listeners not removed
2. Timers not cleared
3. Large arrays growing indefinitely
4. Cached data not garbage collected
5. Closures holding references
6. React state holding old data

Solutions:

1. React Cleanup
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const listener = () => { /* ... */ };
  chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(listener);

  return () => {
    // CLEANUP
    chrome.runtime.onMessage.removeListener(listener);
  };
}, []);
```

2. Storage Limits
```javascript
// Keep only last 1000 sessions
async function pruneOldSessions() {
  const sessions = await getSessionHistory();
  if (sessions.length > 1000) {
    const keep = sessions.slice(-1000);
    await saveSessionHistory(keep);
  }
}
```

3. Cache Invalidation
```javascript
// LRU cache with size limit
class LRUCache {
  constructor(maxSize = 100) { /* ... */ }
  get(key) { /* ... */ }
  set(key, value) {
    if (this.size >= this.maxSize) {
      this.delete(this.oldestKey);
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

4. Service Worker Lifecycle
- Handle terminate event
- Persist state before shutdown
- Restore state on wake
- Clear temporary data

5. Memory Profiling
- Use Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler
- Take heap snapshots before/after actions
- Identify retained objects
- Fix leaks

Monitoring:
```javascript
// Log memory usage periodically
if (performance.memory) {
  console.log({
    used: performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize / 1024 / 1024,
    total: performance.memory.totalJSHeapSize / 1024 / 1024,
    limit: performance.memory.jsHeapSizeLimit / 1024 / 1024
  });
}
```

Provide memory leak test scenarios and fixes.
```
