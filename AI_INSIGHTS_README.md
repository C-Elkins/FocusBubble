# AI Insights Feature - Quick Start

## ✨ What's New

Your Focus Bubble app now includes **AI-powered insights** that generate personalized feedback about your focus sessions!

## 🚀 Quick Demo

1. **Navigate to the app** and complete a focus session
2. **Go to Dashboard** - you'll see a new "AI Insights" card
3. **See your personalized insight** based on your session data

Example insights you might see:
- _"Incredible! You focused for 2.5 hours with only 3 distractions — that's exceptional deep work! 🎯"_
- _"Perfect focus! 50 minutes of uninterrupted deep work. Keep up this momentum! ⭐"_
- _"Solid 1.5 hours of work completed with 5 distractions. Consider using website blockers to reduce interruptions."_

## 🎯 How It Works

The AI analyzes your session data:
- **Total focus time** (hours/minutes)
- **Number of distractions** (tab switches)
- **Completion rate** (% of planned time)
- **Session consistency** (number of sessions)
- **Average session length**

Then generates a natural language insight with:
✅ Performance assessment
✅ Encouraging feedback  
✅ Actionable tips
