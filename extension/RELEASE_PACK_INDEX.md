## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Chrome
Chrome Web Store is the largest. Get approved there first, then Edge/Opera usually auto-approve.

### Tip 2: Privacy Policy is Critical
Host on GitHub Pages for free:
```bash
# Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings
# Put PRIVACY_POLICY.md content in docs/privacy.html
# URL: https://c-elkins.github.io/focusbubble/privacy.html
```

### Tip 3: Reviewer Notes Save Time
Always include "Notes for Reviewers" explaining:
- Why you need each permission
- How to test the extension
- Why <all_urls> is necessary (for floating bubble)

### Tip 4: Version Strategically
- v1.0.0 = Initial release
- v1.0.1 = Bug fixes
- v1.1.0 = New features
- v2.0.0 = Major changes

### Tip 5: Respond to Reviews
Reply to ALL reviews (positive and negative) within 48 hours. Improves ratings and user trust.
