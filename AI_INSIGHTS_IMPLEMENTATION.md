## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Function: `generateAIInsight(sessionData, options)`

**Input:**
```javascript
{
  duration: 3000,           // seconds
  distractions: 2,
  completionRate: 95,       // percentage
  totalSessions: 3,
  averageSessionLength: 1800 // seconds
}
```

**Output:**
```javascript
"Great session! 50 minutes of focused work with minimal distractions. 
You're building excellent focus habits! 💪"
```

### Local Analysis Algorithm

1. **Calculate Performance Tier**
   - Exceptional: 2+ hours, ≤3 distractions
   - Great: 1-2 hours, ≤2 distractions
   - Good: 25-60 min, 0 distractions
   - Needs Work: <25 min

2. **Assess Completion Rate**
   - 90%+: Outstanding
   - 70-89%: Solid
   - 50-69%: Room for improvement
   - <50%: Needs attention

3. **Analyze Distraction Patterns**
   - 0: Perfect focus
   - 1-2: Minimal
   - 3-5: Some
   - 6-8: Many
   - 9+: Excessive

4. **Evaluate Consistency**
   - 1 session: Single focus block
   - 2-3 sessions: Building routine
   - 4+ sessions: Consistent practice

5. **Generate Composite Insight**
   - Combines multiple factors
   - Prioritizes most relevant feedback
   - Adds actionable tip
   - Includes encouraging emoji

### API Integration

**OpenAI Implementation:**
```javascript
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
{
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a productivity coach..." },
    { role: "user", content: promptWithData }
  ],
  max_tokens: 100,
  temperature: 0.7
}
```

**Anthropic Implementation:**
```javascript
POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
{
  model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
  max_tokens: 100,
  messages: [
    { role: "user", content: promptWithData }
  ]
}
```

## 📊 Example Insights by Scenario

**Perfect Session (3000s, 0 distractions)**
> "Perfect focus! 50 minutes of uninterrupted deep work. Keep up this momentum! ⭐"

**Excellent Deep Work (9000s, 3 distractions)**
> "Incredible! You focused for 2.5 hours with only 3 distractions — that's exceptional deep work! 🎯"

**Good Session (5400s, 5 distractions)**
> "Solid 1.5 hours of work completed with 5 distractions. Consider using website blockers to reduce interruptions."

**Needs Work (1200s, 8 distractions)**
> "20 minutes completed with 8 distractions detected. Try airplane mode or a dedicated focus app to create distraction-free time blocks."

**Multiple Sessions (14400s, 6 dist, 5 sessions)**
> "5 sessions completed — you're building a consistent focus routine! Consistency is key to productivity."

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- API keys stored in localStorage
- Suitable for personal/demo use
- No backend required
- Client-side processing

### Production Recommendations
- Backend API proxy
- Encrypted key storage
