## 💡 Pro Tips

### Maximize Focus with FocusBubble

1. **Full-screen mode** - Press F11 for immersive experience
2. **Large monitor** - 24"+ recommended for best effect
3. **Center your window** - Eye-level positioning
4. **Dim your room** - Reduce environmental distractions
5. **Use ambient sounds** - Pair with lo-fi or nature sounds
6. **Close everything else** - Single window = single focus
7. **Don't touch mouse** - Let controls hide, trust the system
8. **Match your breathing** - Sync with the bubble animation
9. **Peripheral vision** - Use to check time without breaking focus
10. **Complete sessions** - Resist urge to end early

### Best Times for Each Interface

**Use FocusBubble for:**

- Morning deep work blocks
- Writing/coding sessions
- Creative work
- Long study sessions
- Meditation practice

**Use Traditional Timer for:**

- Quick pomodoros
- Meetings with breaks
- Time-boxed tasks
- When learning the app
- On small screens

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### Non-Critical

- **Markdown lint warnings** in documentation (formatting only)
- **npm deprecation warnings** (inflight, glob packages - won't affect functionality)
- **Console warnings** possible with React dev mode (normal)

### Performance Notes

- **FocusBubble uses more GPU** due to Framer Motion animations
- **Battery impact** slightly higher than traditional timer
- **Optimization:** All animations use GPU acceleration and `will-change` CSS
